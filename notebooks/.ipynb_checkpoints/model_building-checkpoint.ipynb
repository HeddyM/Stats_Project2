    "### Model Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### R-squared \n",
    "##### R-squared reflects the fit of the model. The R-squared value in this model is 0.167 and the Adjusted R-squared is 0.161 which means that the model is capable of explaining only 16.1% of the patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### P>|t| (p-value)\n",
    "##### The output here shows a p-value of 0.012 or less for each of the indpendant variables. The probablity of the relationship between number of venues, average number of venue reviews, and average venue rating for venues near a location and of free rental bikes available being due to chance is 1.2% or lower. This of course is only applicable for the specific date and time that the city bikes data was retrieved and could change based on the day and time of day that the data is observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Coef\n",
    "##### The coef for the constant and each of the variables is displayed. The interesting one to me is and coef for mean venue rating. It is -11.4077. It indicates a negative correlation between mean venue rating and percent of free bikes at a bike sation. The bike sations with higher rated venues within 1000 metres of the station appear to have a lower percentage of the bikes at that station available for use. This of course could also be because areas where there are higher rated venues also have more atractions, more tourist traffic and are higher populated areas which would explain higher bike rental use.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Confounding Variables\n",
    "##### There are likely other variables that are really the driver behind both the independant and dependant variables in this case, the most obvious ones being the resident population and volume of tourists regularly visiting specific areas of the city. More residents and more tourists would both likely be positively correlated with number of rental bikes being used and number of venues open for business in each region of the city. These are likely confounding variables and should be taken into account when reviewing this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### It should also be noted that the data on bike use was retrieved from the City Bikes API on a specific date and at a specific time. If the data were observed on a different date or at a different time it could impact the model differently. It would make sense to look at some average data or compare the output for data on different days of the week and different months of the year."
